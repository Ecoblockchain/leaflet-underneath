# Leaflet Underneath

Find features or points of interest that lie underneath your mouse pointer (or some other location).

With a normal tile layer, the user can't interact to find out more about a location, since it is a static image. With this plugin, you can find out what features are underneath the current mouse position, for example when the user clicks the map.

This is done using [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/), that are queried for features in a way that is both fast and reasonably bandwidth efficient.

(Note: while this is mostly working, it's currently work-in-progress: feedback and comments welcome, try it out, but use it for serious stuff on your own risk.)
